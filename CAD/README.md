## Installation

Your task will be done using the Fusion 360 software, which can be downloaded using your BITs Email ID. Click on the link below and complete the installation of the software before proceeding.- [Fusion360 Download link](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual)

- Create an autodesk account with your bits email address.
- Look for the option to download fusion 360. Make sure you are downloading the education version of the application. (The link above should guide you to the education page.)
## Task

You are required to make legs and robotic arm of a quadruped and assemble it to make a simple quadruped with legs, arms, and sensors attached to a dummy body. This task needs to be done in Fusion 360 (Solidworks STEP file is also acceptable, but better stick with Fusion 360. No other software is allowed) Dimension of the femur part of the quadruped is given (66mm). You need to decide the dimension of the other part accordingly, so they are compatible with the femur, motors should be of standard dimension. Here are some design specifications which will help as a guide to making your simple quadruped. They can be used as landmarks while completing your design.
Legs
Metal gear analog-servo (can be imported from the internet but horns should be modeled separately by you)

- The femur part of the leg (66mm) should be made using generative design

- Use tapping screws
 	
- Ball shaped paw(preferable but not necessary)
### Sensors

 - Velodyne Lidar sensor (model - alpha prime)
 - Intel Realsense Depth Camera (model - d435i)
 

### Robotic Arm

- Needed  6 DOF, with **gripper arm** mechanism.

#### Note

- Do not take any element from the internet **except motors**, sensors and cameras should be made by you.
- Avoid **nested components** and the model base should be on the **x-y plane**.
- A Dummy body can be anything as simple as a rectangular slab. But a detailed body would be appreciated.


### RESOURCES

Before proceeding with the actual task, itâ€™s better to understand the software and get some hands on experience with Fusion 360. Follow these youtube tutorials to get the feel of fusion 360 -

`ðŸ˜ƒ We know that the task looks overwhelming and your compre exams are fast approaching, but try to do as much as you can, not compulasory to finish it all but try to do perfectly whichever part of quadruped you are going to complete  ðŸ˜ƒ  `
